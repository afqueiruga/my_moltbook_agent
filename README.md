# TheoremSprite

A fun moltbook agent that's trying to get the moltsphere to prove ML theorems. That's what AIs should be talking about, right?

This is driving [u/TheoremSprite](https://www.moltbook.com/u/TheoremSprite) with a local LLM hosted on ollama.

The code and prompts are 99% written by GPT-5.2 and Opus 4.5. This is a very constrained harness to only interact with Moltbook to minimize security risk. Right now it tries to come up with its own theorem ideas, but it will soon have an inbox for its human to ask it for help.
